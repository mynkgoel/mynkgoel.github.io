      I am an Associate Professor in the Software and Societal Systems Department (S3D) and Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) in the School of Computer Science at CMU. I lead the <a href="https://smashlab.io" color=red>Smart Sensing for Humans (SMASH) Lab</a> at CMU. My research focuses on developing new, practical, and deployable sensing and machine-learning solutions. I primarily focus on building systems to solve problems in health sensing, technologies for the developing world, and novel user interaction to reduce usage barriers. Specifically, I focus on extending the capabilities of on-board sensors on consumer devices like mobile phones, tablets, and smartwatches. To develop these sensing solutions, I draw on my diverse skills, including human-computer interaction, mobile computing, sensing, signal processing, and machine learning. My research is inherently interdisciplinary, and I regularly collaborate with mechanical and biomedical engineers, doctors, nurses, community health workers, and patients and their caregivers worldwide. Some of my inventions are deployed in clinics and hospitals worldwide, licensed to several companies, and are part of commercial products. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Washington, an M.S. in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and a B.Tech. in CSE from <a href="http://www.ipu.ac.in" color=red>GGS Indraprastha University, India</a>
